# Story:
Over the course of a weekend, I joined a TAMU-based hackathon to assemble, wire, and program a robot that is able to use camera data, and pick up a neon green box into a plastic cup. I was hard, programming was annoying, training took forever, but I was able to get it to work.

# Skills I've gained
* Reading basic schematics for PCBs and microprocessors
* Wiring data, motion planning, and voltage currents

# Technologies I've used:
* Pytorch (RL)
* Conda (Anaconda Environments)
* Lerobot + Hugging Face ![Link to my Model](https://huggingface.co/highonjuice/act_koch_test) ![Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/highonjuice/koch_test)

# Things that I still need to learn
* Hardware schematics (still got a lot to learn)
* Cuda programming - optimizing the CUDA could've lead to better result and speed
